				A year ago, I was teaching in eastern Thailand, and the dean told me I could have free housing on campus. I went to visit the house. There was a professor living there who was planning to move out. “You won’t be alone,” he said.I didn’t know what he meant. When I walked around, there were pictures of monks, small Buddha statues and amulets hanging from the walls. The house was situated on a potholed road on the edge of campus in what can only be described as jungle. It was so humid there that your shirt stuck to your skin. I decided to move in anyway. My salary was low — $460 a month — and the house was free.I loaded my stuff into the back of a pickup truck — books, computer, clothing and a bed — and moved into a bedroom on the second floor. Another professor moved in across the hall; his specialty was political economy. The electricity in the house wasn’t very reliable. When the power went out, we lighted candles or used our mobile phones to see. The floors creaked as you walked.
